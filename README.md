# Note Taking Web App

A simple web-based note-taking application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **PHP**, and **MySQL**. 
This app allows users to register, 
log in, and manage their notes in an organized and user-friendly interface.

> 📌 Currently optimized for desktop browsers. I'm still working on making the website responsive for mobile phones and tablets.
